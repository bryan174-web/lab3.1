    Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley. Six of the seven species are listed as threatened with extinction globally on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The remaining one, the flatback turtle, is found only in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia.
